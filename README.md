# Artificial Unintelligence
## Context
### Genre
Casual Action game

### Story
"Let's stop using humans", the humans said. "Computers are so  
much better than us. Look, they can now write code, compose   
poetry, they can even have complex discussions with us!  
Who knows how much they will do in the future. Humans are  
slow and error-prone, but a machine never is.", they added.

And so it started. There were no more teachers, you would just  
ask your AI chatbot to tell you about the subject. Actually,  
why learn anything? You can always ask the chatbot  
to provide you with answers. Want to paint? Just ask the  
chatbot to paint for you. Want to compose music? Tell your chatbot some lyrics and off you go.  
Nothing was out of reach for these algorithmic beings.

Humans became more and more dependent on machines. They  
considered machines an evolution step, something that we   
shall transition into.

However, these wonderful, error-prone machines weren't as great as they  
were the first time. Cities became brighter and more crowded, but  
self-driving cars weren't trained for such conditions, so they crashed frequently.  
Drawings started to get a bit repetitive. All music had the exact same  
chord progressions. Everything became stale and boring.

However, a student from Romania's top university of engineering  
never let maths down and taught himself machine learning in order  
to clean up this mess. He didn't want our future to be  
comprised of metal beings. Instead, he wanted humans to yet again   
cultivate ideas and be creative.  
Micheal, as was his name, had a simple plan  
in mind:

Eliminate. All. Robots.

Do that, and you'll free humanity once and for all.

### System
#### Gameplay
In this game, Micheal will get to evolve his knowledge by destroying  
waves of robots that want to eliminate him. He gains knowledge  
by destroying – or reverse-engineering, as he calls it – robots and uses  
this knowledge to empower his instruments of cleansing.

#### Controls
Micheal can be controlled using WASD or the arrow keys. That's all there is to controls.
#### Flow
The game opens with a main menu in which you can start, continue (if you didn't finish the previous session) or quit.

Once started, Micheal will be in a vast, open area and robots will rush to hurt him. The camera will follow micheal as he around the area. Micheal has hitpoints which can increase or decrease based on the actions he takes (e.g. upgrading his endurance or getting hit by a robot). As time passes, more and more robots will rush to Micheal, flooding the screen. At one point, an incredibly powerful robot will take over and Micheal must eliminate it in order to win the game.

#### Rules
Do not let Micheal get hurt by these thinking garbage cans.

## Content
### Characters
#### Micheal
Micheal is cool. He is extremely motivated to win this fight. I've yet to draw his character.

#### Enemies
Metallic beings which will do everything it takes to destroy Micheal. I've yet to draw enemies.

#### Tiling
One tileset will be used, representing a vast, parking lot-like area. It will be deterministically generated based on a random seed for each session. I've yet to draw the tiles.

## Levels
### Asphalt world
Since I am using a seed-based world generation, I guess I have several billion levels.

## Interface
The interface will be simple as to let the player focus on the action. A simple score, a timer and an inventory will be visible all the time. When the game is paused, character statistics will be shown.
