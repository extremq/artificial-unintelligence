## Story
"Let's stop using humans", the humans said. "Computers are so
much better than us. Look, they can now write code, compose 
poetry, they can even have complex discussions with us!
Who knows how much they will do in the future. Humans are
slow and error-prone, but a machine never is.", they added.

And so it started. There were no more teachers, you would just
ask your AI chatbot to teach you whatever you wanted to learn. Actually,
why learn anything? You can always ask the chatbot
to provide you with answers, no need to waste time memorizing. Want to paint? Just ask the
chatbot to paint for you. Want to compose music? Tell your chatbot some lyrics and off you go.
Nothing was out of reach for these algorithmic beings.

Humans became more and more dependent on machines. They
considered machines an evolution step, something that we 
shall transition into.

However, these wonderful, error-prone machines weren't as great as they
were the first time. Cities became brighter and more crowded, but
self-driving cars weren't trained for such conditions, so they crashed frequently.
Drawings started to get a bit repetitive. All music had the exact same
chord progressions. Everything became stale and boring.

But a student from Romania's top university of engineering
never let maths down and taught himself machine learning in order
to clean up this mess. He didn't want our future to be
comprised of metal beings. Instead, he wanted humans to yet again 
cultivate ideas and be creative.
Micheal, as was his name, had a simple plan
in mind:

Eliminate. All. Robots.

Do that, and you'll free humanity once and for all.

## Gameplay
In this game, Micheal will get to evolve his knowledge by destroying
waves of robots that want to eliminate him. He gains knowledge
by destroying – or reverse-engineering, as he calls it – robots and uses
this knowledge to empower his instruments of cleansing.

## Rules
Do not let Micheal get hurt by these thinking garbage cans.

## Characters
### Micheal
Micheal is cool.

## Map
Tiled map.
